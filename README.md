# Explainable Multi-Agent Generative Recommendation System for Personalized Learning

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project proposes an **Explainable Multi-Agent Generative Recommendation System**
for **personalized e-learning**.  
It combines **Agentic AI, Generative AI (LLMs), and Explainable AI (XAI)** to recommend
*and generate* adaptive learning paths while providing **transparent and trustworthy explanations**.

---

## 🎯 Motivation & Context

Current e-learning recommendation systems (collaborative filtering, deep learning)
suffer from major limitations:

- ❌ **Lack of adaptability**: no dynamic reasoning or planning
- ❌ **No content generation**: they recommend but do not create learning material
- ❌ **Black-box models**: lack of explainability → low user trust

This project addresses these issues through a **collaborative multi-agent architecture**
capable of reasoning, generating, and explaining personalized learning pathways.

## 🧪 Scientific Objectives

- Design a **collaborative multi-agent architecture** (memory, planning, communication)
- Integrate **LLMs + RAG** for personalized content generation
- Provide **hybrid explanations** (post-hoc XAI + agentic reasoning)
- Evaluate **recommendation quality** and **user trust**

## 🧠 Multi-Agent Architecture

| Agent | Role | Technologies |
|------|-----|-------------|
| **Profiling Agent** | Learner profile & learning style analysis | Embeddings, clustering, LLM |
| **Path Planning Agent** | Pedagogical path planning | Graph search, RL, heuristics |
| **Content Generator Agent** | Generates lessons & quizzes | LLM, RAG |
| **Recommendation Agent** | Ranks and recommends resources | Hybrid filtering, LLM |
| **XAI Agent** | Explains decisions | SHAP, LIME, counterfactuals |
| **Orchestrator** | Coordinates agents | LangGraph, AutoGen |

## 🔍 Explainable AI Methods

| Method | Example |
|------|--------|
| **SHAP / LIME** | Feature importance from learner profile |
| **Counterfactuals** | “If your score increased by +10%, resource X would be recommended” |
| **Chain-of-Thought** | Structured agent reasoning explanations |
